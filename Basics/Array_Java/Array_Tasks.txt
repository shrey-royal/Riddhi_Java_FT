1. Write a program to find the maximum element in an array.
2. Write a program to find the minimum element in an array.
3. Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
4. Write a program to find the average of all elements in an array.
5. Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array.
6. Write a program to reverse the elements of an array.
7. Write a program to check if an array is sorted in ascending order.
8. Write a program to remove duplicates from an array.
9. Write a program to find the second largest element in an array.
10. Write a program to find the common elements between two arrays.


Complex: 

1. Write a program to find the longest increasing subarray within an array. The program should return the starting and ending indices of the subarray.

2. Given an array of integers, write a program to find the subarray with the maximum sum. The program should return the sum of the subarray and the starting and ending indices.

3. Implement a program to rotate the elements of an array to the right by a given number of positions. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation is 2 positions, the resulting array would be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

4. Write a program to find the intersection of two arrays. The intersection should contain only unique elements that are present in both arrays, and the program should return the intersection as a new array.

> Array -> array of palindrome strings -> check if palindrome or not
ex: ["mom", "dad", "racecar", "bat"] -> [true, true, true, false]

5. Transpose a matrix (rows and columns are swapped)
ex: [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] -> [[1,4,7], [2,5,8], [3,6,9]]

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9

String class -> toCharArray() -> char[]

name = "John"

name[0] = 'J'   -> it's not an array but we can treat it like one

name.toCharArray() -> ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n']
