SQL queries for your table definition along with some common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that you can perform on this table.

**1. Create the table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pizza_lovers (
    person_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    pizza_lover_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    favorite_topping VARCHAR(50),
    topping_confidence INT,
    unusual_combination TINYINT(1)
);
```

This query creates a table named `pizza_lovers` with the specified columns.

**2. Insert a new pizza lover:**

```sql
INSERT INTO pizza_lovers (pizza_lover_name, favorite_topping, topping_confidence, unusual_combination)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'Pepperoni', 8, 0);
```

This query allows you to insert a new pizza lover into the table. You can replace the values with the details of the new pizza lover.

**3. View all pizza lovers:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM pizza_lovers;
```

This query retrieves all pizza lovers and their details from the `pizza_lovers` table.

**4. Update a pizza lover's information:**

```sql
UPDATE pizza_lovers
SET favorite_topping = 'Mushrooms', topping_confidence = 7
WHERE person_id = 1;
```

This query updates the `favorite_topping` and `topping_confidence` for the pizza lover with `person_id` 1. You can modify the values as needed.

**5. Delete a pizza lover:**

```sql
DELETE FROM pizza_lovers
WHERE person_id = 2;
```

This query deletes the pizza lover with `person_id` 2 from the table.

These SQL queries provide basic CRUD operations for managing data in your "pizza_lovers" table. You can use them to interact with the table using your MySQL database.
