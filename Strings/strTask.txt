String Tasks:

1. String Concatenation: Modify the code to concatenate 's1', 's2', and 's3' into a single string and print the result. For example, if 's1' is "Hello," 's2' is "World," and 's3' is "Hello World," the program should output "Hello WorldHelloWorld."

2. String Length: Calculate and display the length of each string ('s1', 's2', 's3', and 's4') in characters. Ensure that the program correctly counts the number of characters in each string.

3. String Comparison: Implement a comparison mechanism to check if 's4' is equal to 's3'. If they are equal, print "s4 is equal to s3," otherwise, print "s4 is not equal to s3."

4. String Manipulation: Modify the program to take an additional user input (a string) and then check if 's3' contains the user-input string. If it does, print "s3 contains the user input," otherwise, print "s3 does not contain the user input."

5. String Case Conversion: Convert 's4' to uppercase and 's2' to lowercase. Print both modified strings. Ensure that the original strings remain unchanged.

6. Word Count: Create a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the number of words in it without using any string methods.
Example:
    Input: "Hello World"

    Output: 2

7. Password Strength Checker: Build a password strength checker that assesses a user's password based on criteria such as length, special characters, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
Example:
    Input: "HelloWorld"

    Output:
    Password length is too short.
    Password does not contain any special characters.
    Password does not contain any uppercase letters.

8. Email Validation: Implement an email validator that checks whether a given string is a valid email address without using regular expressions or string methods.
Example:
    Input: abc@gmail.com

    Output: Valid email address

    Input: abc@gmail

    Output: Invalid email address

9. Palindrome Checker: Develop a program that determines if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) without using string reversal functions.
Example:
    Input: "racecar"

    Output: "racecar is a palindrome"

    Input: "hello"

    Output: "hello is not a palindrome"

10. Sentence Capitalization: Create a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence without using any string methods.

11. URL Parser: Design a program that parses a URL into its components (scheme, host, path, query, etc.) without using any string methods.
Example:
    Input: https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube

    Output:
    Scheme: https
    Host: www.google.com
    Path: /search
    Query: q=youtube

12. Anagram Checker: Write a function that checks if two words are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in different orders) without using string sorting or manipulation functions.
Example:
    Input: "listen", "silent"

    Output: "listen and silent are anagrams"

    Input: "hello", "goodbye"

    Output: "hello and goodbye are not anagrams"

Problem: Text Analyzer

You are tasked with creating a text analyzer program that takes a paragraph as input and performs various operations using the provided methods. The program should be able to process the paragraph and provide insightful information about it. Your task is to implement this text analyzer.

Here are the requirements:

1. Input Paragraph: Accept a multi-sentence paragraph as input from the user.

2. Character Analysis:
   - Implement a function that calculates and displays the number of characters (excluding spaces) in the paragraph using the 'length()' method.

3. Word Extraction:
   - Implement a function that extracts individual words from the paragraph. Split the paragraph into words using the 'split(String regex)' method with space as the delimiter.
   - Calculate and display the total number of words in the paragraph.

4. Search and Replace:
   - Implement a function that prompts the user to input a character to be replaced and a character to replace it with.
   - Use the 'replace(char oldChar, char newChar)' method to replace all occurrences of the specified character in the paragraph.
   - Display the modified paragraph after replacement.

5. Substring Analysis:
   - Implement a function that prompts the user to input a starting index and an ending index for substring extraction.
   - Extract and display the substring using the 'substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)' method.

6. Case Conversion:
   - Implement a function that converts the entire paragraph to lowercase using the 'toLowerCase()' method and displays the result.

7. Search and Indexing:
   - Implement a function that prompts the user to input a word to search for in the paragraph.
   - Use the 'indexOf(String str)' method to find the first occurrence of the input word and display its index.
   - If the word is not found, display a message indicating that.

8. Trimming:
   - Implement a function that removes any leading and trailing spaces from the paragraph using the 'trim()' method.
   - Display the trimmed paragraph.

9. Text Joining:
   - Implement a function that joins the words extracted earlier into a new paragraph using the 'join(CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence... elements)' method.
   - Prompt the user to input a delimiter to be used for joining.

10. Empty Check:
    - Implement a function that checks whether the paragraph is empty (contains no characters) using the 'isEmpty()' method.
    - Display the result.

11. Case Insensitive Comparison:
    - Implement a function that prompts the user to input another paragraph.
    - Use the 'equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString)' method to compare the two paragraphs without considering case.
    - Display whether the two paragraphs are equal or not.

12. Interning Strings:
    - Implement a function that interns the current paragraph using the 'intern()' method.
    - Display the interned paragraph.

Your task is to design and implement the text analyzer program that fulfills these requirements. Use the provided methods to perform the necessary operations on the input paragraph.
